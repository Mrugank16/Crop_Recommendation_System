# Crop Recommendation System
## Overview
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-powered web application designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection based on various environmental factors. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system predicts the most suitable crop for a given set of input parameters such as soil nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

## Features
Predictive Crop Recommendation: Utilizes machine learning models to predict the most suitable crop for a given set of environmental parameters.
User-friendly Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive web interface for users to input their agricultural data and receive crop recommendations.
Backend Processing: Utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, for server-side processing and handling of prediction requests.
Scalable Solution: Designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of new features and integration with other systems in the future.

## Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the backend logic and machine learning models.
Flask: Python web framework used for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
HTML/CSS: Frontend technologies used for designing and styling the user interface.
Machine Learning (ML): Utilizes ML algorithms for predicting crop recommendations based on input parameters.
Scikit-learn: Python library used for implementing machine learning algorithms.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Flask application by executing python app.py in the terminal.
Access the web application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Enter the required input parameters (e.g., N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall) and click the "Predict" button to receive a crop recommendation.
